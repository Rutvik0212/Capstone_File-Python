Hello User!
This is the file for checking the PDF_Generator program.
We are creating a pdf file from the text file you are reading right now.
If you reading this text from pdf file then we have succesfully created pdf file.
For creating the pdf file we are using 'fpdf' module.
This is not a built-in module. so we have to install this module using pip command.
Just type 'pip install fpdf' in your command prompt you are using.
After succesfull installing, you are ready to use this module by simply importing it.
